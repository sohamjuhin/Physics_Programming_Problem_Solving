%Suppose we have a block of mass m that is placed on a frictionless inclined plane with an angle theta to the horizontal. We want to calculate the magnitude of the force F required to prevent the block from sliding down the inclined plane.

%Assuming no friction and negligible air resistance, we can use the following equation:

% F = m * g * sin(theta)

%where g is the acceleration due to gravity.

%Here's the MATLAB code that implements this calculation:

% Input variables
m = 2; % mass of block (kg)
theta = 30; % angle of inclined plane (degrees)
g = 9.81; % acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)

% Convert angle from degrees to radians
theta_rad = theta * pi/180;

% Calculate force required
F = m * g * sin(theta_rad);

% Display result
fprintf('The magnitude of the force required is %.2f Newtons.\n', F);

%In this example, we assume the block has a mass of 2 kg and is placed on an inclined plane with an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal. The magnitude of the force required to prevent the block from sliding down the inclined plane is calculated to be approximately 9.81 Newtons.

%You can modify the input variables to solve the problem for different scenarios
